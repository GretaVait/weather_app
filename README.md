# Weather App

## About

Simple weather app with integrated [darksky.net](https://darksky.net/) API displaying current location time zone and temperature. Also, this app has integrated [opencagedata.com](https://opencagedata.com/api) API for allowing users to search and find other locations weather.

In this project users can:
- view weather app on any device
- view their current location weather
- view entered location weather
- change temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa
